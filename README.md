# fp-ts-std

The missing pseudo-standard library for [fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/).

Documentation: [samhh.github.io/fp-ts-std](https://samhh.github.io/fp-ts-std/)

> [!NOTE]
> fp-ts-std is no longer actively developed as the fp-ts ecosystem is broadly migrating to [Effect](https://effect.website). It is still maintained with respect to bug fixes and accepting contributions.

## Installation

The library is available on the npm registry under the same package name: [fp-ts-std](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fp-ts-std)

fp-ts, [newtype-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/newtype-ts/), and [monocle-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/monocle-ts/) are peer dependencies.

fp-ts-std is published with both ES2015 and CJS modules, the former of which should tree shake well. Modern ES modules are not supported as per fp-ts.

Node LTS, Bun, and recent evergreen browsers are supported.

## Objectives

fp-ts-std aims to achieve the following objectives:

- Flesh out what fp-ts is missing
- Fill in the gaps between fp-ts and Ramda
- Wrap JS APIs to be friendly, so that you never have to interact with `null` or `undefined`, or worry about a function throwing again

## Ethos

fp-ts-std strives to adhere to the following principles:

- Strict type-safety wherever possible, with risks well documented
- All functions are curried
- Functions are data-last as a rule
- Functions are total unless explicitly prefixed with "unsafe" (with the exception of the `Debug` module)
- Impure functions are appropriately signed with the `IO` and `Task` types
- Lean towards Haskell naming conventions and idioms with an eye to fp-ts norms

Additionally, fp-ts-std enforces 100% testing coverage, and just about everything is documented with examples.

## Contributing

Unreleased work is commit to the `develop` branch. `master` is the release branch and whence the documentation is generated.

All modules and exports must be annotated with JSDoc. This information is used to generate documentation. Simple, illustratory tests can also be included and will be checked during docs generation. For more information, see [docs-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/docs-ts).
